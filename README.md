# Bird Pictures Recognition

### Description
This project retrieves thousands of photos of Eastern Bluebird and random photos. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network is used to determine if a photo is a bird photo.

### Motivation
This was made as an introduction to CNNs, in order to create a Generative Adversial Network creating birds photos later.

### Technologies used
- PyTorch for the CNN model and training
- Flickr API for the pictures scraping

### How to use
Open the main file of the repo, [CNN - Birds Photos Recognotion](https://github.com/timothewt/Bird_Pictures_Recognition/blob/main/CNN_Bird_Photos_Recognition.ipynb)g, and click on "Open in Colab" at the top of the file. To avoid downloading the pictures, you'll have to import the dataset in your GDrive.
